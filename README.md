# hi, i'm tom

ui designer | student | aspiring creative

currently a high school senior in France, with aspirations in ui design.  
i enjoy creating user-centered interfaces with a mix of flat design and depth for a modern, functional aesthetic.

recently contributed to **papillon**, an app aiming to modernize the student experience.  
i share my design thoughts and work on twitter, where iâ€™ve built a community of 1,000+ followers

## what i'm working on:
- improving my ui/ux design skills
- exploring new design trends and tools
- testing things
